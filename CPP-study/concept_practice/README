we will be using the g++ compiler for the C++ code and the c code would be using gcc compiler


# Singleton.cpp is a cpp code which is using the  thread library 
#Compile the file 
$ g++ -pthread -o run  Singleton.cpp



#TODO
1. Would need to add the make which should be configurable and create the binary for the 
file which has been create or edited recently 

2. another approach is to create a menu driven code for the testing
